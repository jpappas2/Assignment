    <h2>Swim Safety</h2>

    <p>Sometimes, people might not be aware of if there are lifeguards on deck while getting in the water.
        This can lead to something very bad happening, especially if the water is deeper than the person
        in the water is. We at swim safety want everyone to be ok if they find themselves in this location,
        and enforce safety as our #1 goal. The beginner class is designed to make sure all swimmers
        can stay in the water for 2 minutes, and can tread water and move around the water by themselves.</p>
